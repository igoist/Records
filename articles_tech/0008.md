* How to get the runtime diff?
* How to replace all children of a HTMLElement/DOM
* How to set up React HMR environment


## How to get the runtime diff?

```javascript
console.time('sort');
arr.sort();
console.timeEnd('sort'); // console result -- sort: 542.668701171875ms
```


## How to replace all children of a HTMLElement/DOM?

If you simply want to replace all children, regarding of the type, why don't you just set its content to '' and then add your code:

```javascript
container.innerHTML = '';
container.appendChild(newContainerElements); // or fragment (suggest)
```


## How to set up React HMR environment?

In order to set up React HMR env, you should know about several points like belows:

**hot vs --hot vs new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin()**

Now the devServer.hot has been deprecated.

If '--hot' & 'new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin()' are indicated at the same time, you could get the 'Maximum call stack size exceeded' error.

The solution: you just need to indicate one of them.
