# JS 不成文笔记

Just for recording some points casually.

*Questions*

* How to get the runtime diff?
* How to replace all children of a HTMLElement/DOM
* How to set up React HMR environment
* How to create a N length array

## How to get the runtime diff?

```javascript
console.time('sort');
arr.sort();
console.timeEnd('sort'); // console result -- sort: 542.668701171875ms
```


## How to replace all children of a HTMLElement/DOM?

If you simply want to replace all children, regarding of the type, why don't you just set its content to '' and then add your code:

```javascript
container.innerHTML = '';
container.appendChild(newContainerElements); // or fragment (suggest)
```


## How to set up React HMR environment?

In order to set up React HMR env, you should know about several points like belows:

**hot vs --hot vs new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin()**

Now the devServer.hot has been deprecated.

If '--hot' & 'new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin()' are indicated at the same time, you could get the 'Maximum call stack size exceeded' error.

The solution: you just need to indicate one of them.


## How to create a N length array

```js
// way -2
Array.apply(null, Array(5)).map(Number.prototype.valueOf,0);

// way -1
new Array(5+1).join('0').split('')

// way 0
var ary = new Uint8Array(10);

// way 1 - ES6 'fill' method
var arr = new Array(10);
arr.fill(0);

// way 2 - the traditional
var arr = [];for(var n = 0; n < 100; n++) arr[n] = 0

// way 3 - 2022.07.06
var arr = Array(100).fill(0);
```
the performance of 'arr[n] = 0' is the best over all
