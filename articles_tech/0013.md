## 关于 Hooks


### Why there is no callback for setState, useEffect

Because it invokes a thought pattern that may very well be an antipattern with hooks.

With hooks, you are writing code more declarative than imparative.

The thought of "do one thing THEN do another thing THEN do another thing" would be the imparative (here: callback- or promise-based) way.

What actually should be done in the hooks model would rather be a "if this has been rendered, and this property is different than before, X should be done to reach the target state", which is more declarative. You don't designate when stuff happens, but just give a condition/dependency and let react pick the right point in time for it.
