# Prettier 折腾小记


## Visual Studio Code Settings

You can use VS Code settings to configure prettier. Settings will be read from (listed by priority):

* Prettier configuration file
* .editorconfig
* Visual Studio Code Settings (Ignored if any other configuration is present)

NOTE: If any local configuration file is present (i.e. .prettierrc) the VS Code settings will *NOT* be used.
